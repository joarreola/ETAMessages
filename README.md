# ETAMessages
Class project

- How to test (recommend to do in extended View: ^)

	Mobile Mode:

		- Tap Enable button:
		  Display changes from "- locationManager..." to local coordinates.

		- Update location via simulator menu:
		  Debug -> Location -> CustomLocation:
		  Blue dot will move to new location, mapView will be centered.


	Stationary Mode with Mobility Simulator:

		- Tap Poll button:
		  Local and Remote coordinates are noted in the display.
		  
		- Tap the Simulate button:
		  Remote user location is noted with a pointAnnotation (red pin)
		  to the left of screen, local user noted with blue dot. eta and
		  distance data is appended to the display. mapView is refreshed,
		  centered between users, span'ed appropriately to cover most of
		  mapView.

		- Remote user (red pin) will incrementally move closer to the
		  blue dot. Remote longitude, eta, and distance will be updated
		  in the display UILabel. A wide, red progress view will appear
		  above the ToolBar along with a centered progressLabel.
		  
		  Both progressView and progressLabel will be updated as the red
		  pin gets closer to the blue dot (decreasing). And will disappear
		  when the pin and dot locations are equal. Fetch and Upload
		  Activity stop.
		  
		- Tap Disable button to reset the app and the screen.
		
	Known Issues:
		- Reloading the app via the txt-msgs app-store may result in
		  corrupted mapView.
		
		
- How did you organize the project's code and resources?

  - Cloud.swift
    Upload, fetch, save, delete a record to/from iCloud repo.
    
    Post-Review Updates:
    - Update upload() to take in whenDone closure , and to call
      back with result whenDone(result). Call publicDatabase.delete()
      directly in upload(), call publicDatabase.save() in success
      path of publicDatabase.delete() closure.
    - Remove semaphore locks in deleteRecord(). Remove saveRecord().
      Re-implement fetchRecord() to take in a whenDone closure, which
      will be called with a packet argument.
    - Update to use the packet.setLocation() methods.
    - Remove pre-comments code.
    - Re-enable an error print().
    
    - Start and Stop upload activity indicator in upload().

    - Remove references to etaProgress and progressLabel.
    - Remove print lines.
    - Don't update pin, display, or mapView in pollRemote(). Do instead in
      getEtaDistance().

    display updates.

    Post-Review Updates:
    - Update to accomodate the to-optional changes in Location.swift
    - Return the larger of the lat/long deltas in centerView(). Use as
      span delta suggestions in refreshMapView(). Cleanup ternary operator use

  - ETANotifications.swift - New File
    Configure, register, and schedule local notifications.



  - LocalNotificationDelegate.swift - New file.
    Responding to actionable notifications and receiving notifications
    while your app is in the foreground


  - PseudoNotificationsViewController.swift - New file.
    View holding a UILabel to present a blue background and a "Has Arrived"
    message. Instantiated in PollManager.etaNotification() when ETA == 0
    (or close enough).
    
  - MobilitySimulator.swift - New file.
    Simulate iPhone device mobility by updating iCloud record directly.
    
    - Reduce step increments to 0.0025 when will jump over destination.
    - Take and Pass the upload Activity indicator for uploadToIcloud()
      calls.
    - Reduce step increments to 0.0005 when will jump over destination.
    - Update location record every 2 sec (vs. 1).
    - Reduce step increments to 0.00025 when will jump over destination.
    - Add a remote paramater to startMobilitySimulator() to note the
      simulation is for the remote location. Also update user's location
      struct fields. Set mobilitySimulatorEnabled to false when stopping
      simulation.


  - MessagesViewController.swift
    Manages the UI implemented in IBACtion functions enable() and poll().
    The mobile user enters the app via the Enable button, the stationary
    users does so via the Poll button. Local location changes come in to
    the locationManager() CLLOcation callback function.
    
    A UILabel notes local and remote coordinate data, and eta/distance
    info. At times it reports specific app state, sort of like a console.
    
    Post-Review Updates:
    - Update upload.uploadLocation() call to pass a closure.
      Update gpsLocation.uploadToIcloud() call to pass a closure.
    - Add display argument to gpsLocation.checkRemote() call. Call
      self.pollManager.fetchRemote() with a closure that is called back
      with a packet argument. Call displayUpdate() in main DispatchQueue.
      Move display updates into self.eta.getEtaDistanc() closure.
    - Unwrap locations.last in locationManager(). Set self.localUser.location
      directly to lmPacket per GPSLocation changes. Call
      self.handleUploadResult(result) in self.gpsLocation.uploadToIcloud()
      closure, in locationManager(). Add handleUploadResult() method that
      takes in a closure to process the uploadToIcloud() result, updating
      the display with appropriate messages, and calling gpsLocation.checkRemote()
      if polling had been enabled. Added handleCheckRemoteResult() method that
      takes in a closure to handle the result of the checkRemote() call.
      Call startUpdatingLocation() and enableUploading() in poll() respond to
      stationary user movement during or after polling.
    - Update to use the Location(userName:location) initializer and the
      setLocation() method.
    - Remove pre-comments code.
    - Add viewWillAppear() override. Add delegate for local notifications.
    - Set pollManager.messagesVC property to self to instantiate
      PseudoNotificationsViewController.
    - Change Food button to Simulate add IBAction to mobilitySumulation. Add
      support for mobility-simulation. Remove reseting of poll_enabled.
    - Move out handleUploadResult() and handleCheckRemoteResult() to
      GPSsLocation.swift.
    - Call pollRemote() inside the success path of the fetchRemote() closure,
      right after calling getEtaDistance().

    - Don't refreshMapView() in locationManager() if polling.
    - Plug in Fetch and Upload Activity Indicators, pass in for
      uploadLocation() and uploadToIcloud() calls.
    - Add etaPogress and progressDisplay. Pass to pollRemote().
    - Reduce hight of etaPogress bar. Cleat etaPogress and progressDisplay
      in disable().
    - Increase etaPogress bar height.
    - Remove commented-out code in poll(). Don't call getEtaDistance() in
      pollManager.fetchRemote() success path.
    - Don't need to get an instance of EtaAdapter. Reference eta as class
      property of EtaAdapter without instantiating EtaAdapter. Don't pass
      EtaAdapter to handleUploadResult() nor pollRemote().
    - Add fetchActivity support. Reset vars when in poll(), simulate() and
      disable().
    - Move etaProgress and progressLabel to EtaAdapter Container View controller.
    - Update mobilitySimulator.stopMobilitySimulator() call to coordinate
      with Polling. And vice-versa.
      
 
 
- What is the project supposed to do?
  In an environment consiting of two mobile devices, the ETAMessages app
  delivers local notification of remote-user's ETA to Stationary device,
  and uploads location data to iCloud from the Mobile-user's device.
  
- What is working?
  All of the above are working as expected. Remote-User location can be
  read from iCloud records, as the devices get closer, the mapView span is
  updated to zoom in. Mobile device location coordinates are updated to
  iCloud repo. ETA and distance data extraction is working.
  
- What is not?
  Can't receive remote or local notifications. This is expected behavior
  for a Messages Extension, will need to incorporate as a target of a
  parent app.
  
- Are there any problems that you know you need to fix?
  
  MapView corruption and missing mapView on some launches.
  
  
- Are there any areas where you would like help?

  Not yet.
  
  
- TODO:
	- Implement local notifications for has-arrived notice.
	- Implement remote notification from iCloud record server.
	- Consider pop-up menu to enable/disable stationary and mobile modes.
	  Or possibly just note if enabled/disabled
	  by changing the button item background?
	  Then Remove the Disable button.
	- Add directions overlay to mapView.
